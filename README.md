# LIFE PALETTE
## CSCI 4100U Final Project - Life Palette App

### Project Overview
Together we are creating a lifestyle companion app called “Life Palette”, which is meant to be an all-in-one solution to improve day-to-day troubles for users. The app will be packed with numerous features, looking to take what is often managed through numerous different apps and integrate it into one controlled space for ease of use. Key features include virtual wardrobe management, recipe cataloging, and a personal journal – all implemented with a focus on minimalism and simplicity in mind. Designed as an advanced personal storage and high-functionality notes app with a focus on personal improvement and well-being, we seek to create a sleek, seamless experience for all users.

### Features
Wardrobe Management: Users will be able to manually register clothing in their wardrobe by taking photos of garments and organizing them with the use of tags and clothing categories (i.e. tops, bottoms, warm weather clothing, basics, etc.). Users will be able to easily browse through their collection of clothes from anywhere while on the go. 

Recipe Catalog: A recipe storage feature where users will be able to log their favourite meals and organize them with various tags for categorization. Users will be able to easily view quick statistics about the recipes (time to prepare, personal rating, etc.), and once clicked on, the recipe will show a full detail display, including steps, any images, and any personal comments or edits. Recipes may be favourited so that they may be viewed separately in the event of search filtering. 

Personal Journal: Users will be prompted to log their daily mood(s), activities, and thoughts throughout their day, creating a space for personal reflection and insight. Users will be able to view date-specific entries through search functionality, as well as see various mood and activity trends as more entries are made and data is collected. As a potential future addition, the inclusion of several journaling prompts could be added to help prompt users who may have difficulty journaling their thoughts and feelings without a specific goal in mind.
